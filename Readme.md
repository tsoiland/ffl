See src/main/java/com/skagenfondene/ffl/Main.java for code and data.csv for data.

It's a standard gradle project. I've included intellij project files (we usually don't do this but it's easier to get started that way). 
Everything is pure java code. The only dependency is the H2-database-driver, which you'll switch with a mysql-driver pretty soon.

If you try and run it it should crash about half way through because I haven't bothered making a real schema, so you'll have to figure out the rest.
